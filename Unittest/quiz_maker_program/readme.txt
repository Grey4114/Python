Program: Quiz Maker
Details:
Make an application which takes various questions from a file, picked randomly, and puts together a quiz for students.
Each quiz can be different and then reads a key to grade the quizzes.

Note:
The script quiz_maker.py script has been broken into 2 scripts - main & functions.  These scripts are updated/refined versions of the original.  
Also there is Unittest test script for the functions script.
