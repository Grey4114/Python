Program: Count Vowels
Details:
Enter a string and the program counts the number of vowels in the text.
For added complexity have it report a sum for each vowel found.

Note:
The script vowel_counter.py script has been broken into 2 scripts - main & functions.
These scripts are updated/refined versions of the original.
Also there is Unittest test script for the functions script.
