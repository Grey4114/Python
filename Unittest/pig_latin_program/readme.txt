    the word and "ay" is added.
    Examples are:
    "banana" = "ananabay"
    "string" = "ingstray"
    "trash" = "ashtray"
    "me" = "emay"

    Words that begin with vowel sounds, the vowel is left alone and 'way' is added to the end of the word.
    Examples are:
    "eat" = "eatyay"
    "omelet" = "omeletay"
    "I"= "Iyay"
