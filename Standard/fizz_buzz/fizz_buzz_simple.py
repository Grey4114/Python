Program Detail:
    The program prints the numbers 1 to 100.
    But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”.
    For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

Notes:
    Ther are 3 other scripts that take this simple program to a new level.
